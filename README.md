# CS231n Assignments Solutions Spring 2020

The last weeks I have been following the course of Stanford [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/index.html) and this repository is a compilation of my solutions for the assignments proposed on the course.

In each folder you will find a README.md file with the instructions for the assignments, the same that you can find on the page of the course. I totally recommend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to complete the assignments!  

###  Assignment 1

- [k-Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/israfelsr/CS231n/blob/master/assignment1/knn.ipynb)

- [Softmax Classifier](https://github.com/israfelsr/CS231n/blob/master/assignment1/softmax.ipynb)
- [Two-Layer Neural Network](https://github.com/israfelsr/CS231n/blob/master/assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb)
- [Image Features](https://github.com/israfelsr/CS231n/blob/master/assignment1/features.ipynb)
